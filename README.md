## Feedback

There's still room for a lot of improvements, i had just a little change to make some changes. The build broke some images i wanted to add i think i messed up some pathing for the deploy. I could create custom hooks while fetching data for more readibility, add some routing to handle better tha pagination, and maybe some more elements inside the pokemons card. i would do some refactors to the map functions and the validations.
